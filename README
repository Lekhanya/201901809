Machine Problem 1
=================

1. After extracting the contents of 201901809.zip, 
   navigate to the 201901809/ folder on the terminal
   and run make

Furthermore the 201901809/ folder contains:
    - Figure_1.png: which shows the data points on a 2D plane
                    and the best hypothesis, generated from 
                    running the code
    - random_data.csv: this document contains the randomly 
                       generated data points as per requirement 1. 
    - Makefile: runs "python main.py"
